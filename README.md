# nltk

Projects with python's Natural Language Toolkit (nltk), which provides functionality for a wide variety of different text mining tasks. Specifically, Iâ€™ll be trying out: tokenizing, removing stop words, stemming, building a term-document matrix, and building a similarity matrix. These are the core steps to enable document comparison, classification, and clustering.
